## Contributing

Note: preceding my normal "contributions welcome" message is a disclaimer that this bot is specifically made for a Discord guild I'm in. If you want to contribute a bit, you're welcome to, but the intent of this bot won't really grow.

Please feel free to contribute. Please open an issue first (or comment on an existing one) so that I know that you want to add/change something.

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license,
shall be dual licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.
